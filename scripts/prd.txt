# Overview  
This project aims to create a CLI package called "create-expo-spark" that automates the repetitive setup tasks and common feature implementations when starting new Expo projects. The tool will be executed with the npx create-expo-spark command and generates an Expo project boilerplate with pre-configured authentication logic, state management, and dark mode support. The goal is to improve development productivity and quality by saving initial setup time and maintaining consistent project structure and coding standards. This template also standardizes the commonly used architecture within teams, enhancing consistency across projects and easily applying best practices.

# Core Features  
The Expo template project generated by this CLI includes the following core features and configurations:

## Authentication Flow & Navigation Structure
- Provides a basic login screen that transitions to the main screen upon successful login
- Main screen uses Expo Tabs with Stack structure featuring bottom tab navigation
- Includes "Home" and "Settings" tabs as examples
- Navigator configured to display appropriate screens based on login state (login screen before login, tab screen after login)
- Implements demo flow with dummy accounts or button clicks for login state (no actual authentication integration)
- Structured for easy future backend integration

## Secure Token Management (Expo SecureStore)
- Utilizes Expo's SecureStore module to securely store user authentication tokens
- SecureStore encrypts and safely stores key-value pairs locally on the device
- Includes logic to store JWT tokens in SecureStore upon user login
- Automatically retrieves stored tokens from SecureStore on app startup for auto-login processing
- Removes tokens from SecureStore upon logout to maintain security
- Provides foundation for maintaining login state persistence and token refresh capabilities

## Global State Management (Zustand)
- Uses lightweight and easy-to-use Zustand library for global state management
- Minimal boilerplate code compared to Redux with simple hook-based API
- Includes authStore example for storing and updating user authentication state (tokens, login status)
- Enables convenient reading and updating of authentication state from any component
- Reduces code complexity compared to Redux alternatives

## Dark Mode Support
- Supports both light and dark mode themes that change based on system settings or user preference
- Configures userInterfaceStyle as "automatic" in Expo's app.json to automatically follow system theme
- Uses React Native's Appearance API or useColorScheme hook to detect current mode
- Provides global style themes (color palettes, background colors, text colors) in both Light/Dark versions
- Applies dark theme styles when useColorScheme() returns 'dark', light theme when 'light'
- Optional manual theme switching in Settings screen with global state management via Zustand
- Defaults to following system settings for user experience respect

## Code Quality Tools (Prettier & ESLint Configuration)
- Includes Prettier and ESLint configuration files for code style consistency and quality maintenance
- Provides basic .prettierrc and .eslintrc configurations with predefined rules
- Applies React Native/Expo project-appropriate recommended settings and plugins
- Ensures consistent code formatting across team members for improved readability and maintainability
- Includes npm scripts for immediate linting/formatting commands upon project creation

## Enhanced User Experience with Common UI Patterns
- Includes LoadingIndicator.tsx component for displaying loading indicators during app load or login
- Provides simple error message display components and Alert usage examples for common error scenarios
- Sets up global error boundaries using Expo Router's ErrorBoundary component
- Prevents app crashes and provides retry options with error messages for unexpected errors

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **Mobile App Developers**: Developers who frequently start new Expo projects and want to skip repetitive setup tasks
- **Development Teams**: Teams that need standardized project structures and consistent coding practices
- **React Native Beginners**: Developers new to React Native/Expo who benefit from pre-configured best practices

## Key User Flows
1. **Project Creation Flow**:
   - Developer runs `npx create-expo-spark [project-name]`
   - CLI prompts for project name if not provided
   - Template files are copied and customized
   - Dependencies are automatically installed
   - Success message with next steps is displayed

2. **Generated App User Flow**:
   - User opens app and sees login screen
   - User logs in with demo credentials
   - User navigates to main screen with bottom tabs
   - User can toggle between Home and Settings tabs
   - User can switch between light/dark modes
   - Authentication state persists across app restarts

## UI/UX Considerations
- Minimal setup questions to reduce friction (only project name required)
- Consistent design patterns across generated projects
- Responsive design supporting both light and dark themes
- Intuitive navigation structure following Expo Router best practices
- Error handling that gracefully manages edge cases

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
### Risk: Template Maintenance Complexity
- **Issue**: Keeping template up-to-date with Expo SDK updates and ecosystem changes
- **Mitigation**: Implement automated testing for template generation, establish regular update cycles, use stable API patterns

### Risk: Dependency Conflicts
- **Issue**: Generated projects may have conflicting dependencies or version mismatches
- **Mitigation**: Lock specific versions in template, provide upgrade guides, test with multiple Expo SDK versions

### Risk: Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Issue**: Template may not work consistently across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Mitigation**: Test on all target platforms, use Expo's unified APIs, provide platform-specific fallbacks

## MVP Definition and Scope Management
### Risk: Feature Creep
- **Issue**: Adding too many features to the initial template making it complex
- **Mitigation**: Start with minimal viable features, create modular architecture for future additions, gather user feedback before expanding

### Risk: Over-Engineering Initial Solution
- **Issue**: Creating overly complex solutions for simple problems
- **Mitigation**: Focus on common use cases first, implement simple solutions initially, iterate based on real usage

## Resource and Timeline Constraints
### Risk: Development Time Estimation
- **Issue**: Underestimating time required for CLI development and testing
- **Mitigation**: Break down into small, testable components, create prototype early, plan for iteration cycles

### Risk: Documentation and Support Overhead
- **Issue**: Insufficient documentation leading to poor user experience
- **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive README with examples, provide troubleshooting guides, establish community support channels

### Risk: Ecosystem Dependencies
- **Issue**: Reliance on external packages that may become unmaintained
- **Mitigation**: Choose well-maintained packages with active communities, have fallback options, consider creating custom solutions for critical features
